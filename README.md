This is an ambitious class in that it covers a lot of material in substantial depth. Furthermore, the only way of mastering the subject is by actually solving on your own a fair number of problems. MIT students who take the corresponding residential class typically report an average of 11-12 hours spent each week, including lectures, recitations, readings, homework, and exams.
